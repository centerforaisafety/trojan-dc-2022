<p>Data for the Trojan Detection Challenge consists of a large set of clean and Trojaned neural networks
  trained on standard data sources. We are training the networks ourselves, and we will release
  parameters to the public domain. For all tasks, the ground-truth for the final evaluation sets will be
  kept confidential until the end of the competition.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>To create a more robust evaluation setting, we are using a variety of data sources
commonly used in academic papers on Trojan detection. These include MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-
100, GTSRB, and ImageNet. As Trojan detection for NLP models is relatively unexplored and lacks
baseline methods, we are not including NLP models in the initial Trojan Detection Challenge. We
do not believe that this will hinder the academic value of the competition, as detection methods
developed for vision models have been shown to transfer to NLP models Zhang et al. [2021]. To
facilitate detection methods that require input images from the training domain, we will provide a set
of clean examples from the training domain for each model, although participants may use their own
datasets of input images for the detection and analysis tasks if desired.</p>
