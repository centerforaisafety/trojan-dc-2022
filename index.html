title: Trojan Detection Challenge

<p>A growing concern for the security of ML systems is the possibility for Trojan
attacks on neural networks. There is now considerable literature for methods
detecting these attacks. We propose the Trojan Detection Challenge to further
the communityâ€™s understanding of methods to construct and detect Trojans. This
competition will consist of complimentary tracks on detecting/analyzing Trojans
and creating evasive Trojans. Participants will be tasked with devising methods to
better detect Trojans using a new dataset containing over 10,000 neural networks.
Code and evaluations from four established baseline detectors will provide a starting
point, and a novel Minimal Trojan baseline attack will challenge participants to
push the state-of-the-art in Trojan detection. At the end of the day, we hope our
competition spurs practical innovations and clarifies deep questions surrounding
the offense-defense balance of Trojan attacks.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Open Format:</b> This is an open competition. All participants are encouraged to share their methods
for a joint publication. To be eligible for prizes, winning teams are required to share their methods,
code, and models (at least with the organizers, although public releases are encouraged).</li>
  <li><b>Training Data:</b> Teams may only submit results of models trained on the provided training set of
Trojaned and clean networks. Training additional networks from scratch is not allowed, as it gives
teams with more compute an unfair advantage.</li>
  <li><b>Detection Methods:</b> Using data augmentation is allowed as long as it does not involve training
additional networks from scratch. Using inputs from the data sources (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10,
etc.) is allowed.</li>
  <li><b>Rule breaking</b> may result in disqualification, and significant rule breaking will result in an
ineligibility for prizes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this is only the second time that a Trojan detection competition has been held, it is not clear
  exactly what the right rules are. These rules are an initial set, and we require participants to consent
  to a change of rules if there is an urgent need during registration. If a situation should arise that was
  not anticipated, we will implement a fair solution, ideally using consensus of participants.</p>
