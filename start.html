<h2>Tracks</h2>

<h4>Trojan Detection Track</h4>
<p>Participants will be given a dataset of Trojaned and clean networks
  spanning multiple data sources, which they can use to train a Trojan detector. The task is to classify
  a test set of networks with held-out labels (Trojan, clean).</p>

<h4>Trojan Analysis Track</h4>
<p>Trojan Analysis Track: Participants will be given a dataset of Trojaned networks spanning multiple
  data sources. In multiple subtracks, participants will predict various properties of Trojaned
  networks on a test set with held-out labels. Analysis tasks include predicting the attackâ€™s target
  label, predicting the nominal location of the trigger, and reverse-engineering the trigger.</p>

<h4>Evasive Trojan Track</h4>
<p>Participants will be given a dataset of clean networks and a list of attack
  specifications including desired performance level. Participants will train a small set of Trojaned
  networks and upload them to an evaluation server. The server will verify that the attack specifica-
  tions are met, then train and evaluate a baseline Trojan detector using held-out clean networks and
  the submitted Trojaned networks. The task is to create Trojaned networks that are hard to detect.
  Due to the novelty of this problem setting and evaluation format, this is a pilot track. We intend to
  have two subtracks: one in MNIST and one in CIFAR-10. We will take measures to ensure that
  participants have sufficient compute resources to experiment and train the networks.</p>
