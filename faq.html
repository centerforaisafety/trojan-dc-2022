    <li><b>Where do we download data and submit results?</b> The dataset and CodaLab competition will be announced soon.</li>
    <li><b>How many submissions can each team enter per competition track?</b> In each track, teams are restricted to 5 submissions per day on the validation set. For test sets, teams are restricted to 5 submissions total. Only one account per team can be used to submit results. Creating multiple accounts to circumvent the submission limits will result in disqualification.</li>
    <li><b>Are participants required to share the details of their method?</b> We encourage all participants to share their methods and code, either with the organizers or publicly. To be eligible for prizes, winning teams are required to share their methods, code, and models with the organizers.</li>
    <li><b>Can the first-place team in the Evasive Trojans track also participate in the second round of the competition?</b> To avoid an unfair advantage, the winning team of the Evasive Trojans track will not be allowed to compete in the final round.</li>
